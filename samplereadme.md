### ‚úÖ **Question 9**

The Sales Team wants to build a list of KPIs to measure employees' performances. In order to help them they asked you to provide them a list of employees with:

1. their full name (first name and last name combined in a single field)
2. their job title
3. their total sales amount excluding discount (formatted to have only 2 decimals)
4. their total number of orders
5. their total number of entries (each row of an order)
6. their average amount per entry (formatted to have only 2 decimals)
7. their average amount per order (formatted to have only 2 decimals)
8. their total discount amount (formatted to have only 2 decimals)
9. their total sales amount including discount (formatted to have only 2 decimals)
10. Their total discount percentage (formatted to have only 2 decimals)

Finally order the results by total sales amount including discount (descending).

### ‚úÖ **Question 10**
The Sales Team wants to build another list of KPIs to measure employees' performances across each category. In order to help them they asked you to provide them a list of categories and employees with:

1. their categories name
2. their full name (first name and last name combined in a 3. single field)
3. their total sales amount including discount (formatted to have only 2 decimals)
4. their percentage of total sales amount against the total sales amount across all employees (formatted to have only 2 decimals)
5. their percentage of total sales amount against the total sales amount for each employees (formatted to have only 2 decimals)

Finally order the results by category name (ascending) then total sales amount (descending).
